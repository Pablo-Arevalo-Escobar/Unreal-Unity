### **Boids** 
A C++ Unreal implementation of simple boid behaviour based on the principles described by the following wikipedia page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids

Three key steps in the algorithm:

1. Alignment:

- Steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
	
2. Separation:

- Steer to avoid local flockmates
	
3. Cohesion:

- Steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates
